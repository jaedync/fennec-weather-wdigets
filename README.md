3. Scroll down and find the Scriptable app in the widget list. Tap on it.

4. Choose the medium widget size and tap on the "Add Widget" button.

5. Tap on the newly added widget to open the widget configuration screen.

6. Tap on the "Script" field and select the script you created in the previous section.

7. Customize any additional settings for the widget, such as the location or appearance.

8. Tap on the "Done" button to save the widget configuration.

9. Exit the jiggle mode by pressing the home button or swiping up from the bottom of the screen.

- Setup for the lock screen is similar to the home screen. Add the small size Scriptable widget, and select the Lock Screen script.
